What is it?
This is just a simple script to auto dodge - moving left ,right ,jump in a loop, in Nexuiz. 
While one may not be able to dodge perfectly, the auto script can be fun.
 Mechanism: A loop is created using alias and menu_cmd rpn commands and keys are bind to start and stop auto dodging 
Setup: Create an autoexec.cfg file in Nexuiz/data folder under windows or .Nexuiz/data under linux. 
Now copy and paste the dodge script directly into the autoexec.cfg file or simply create dodge.cfg and 
call it from autoexec adding the line "exec dodge.cfg". 
The autoexec will execute everytime Nexuiz client starts and you are good to go.

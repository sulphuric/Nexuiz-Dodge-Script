What is it?
This is just a simple script to auto dodge - moving left ,right ,jump in a loop, in Nexuiz. While one may not really be able to dodge perfectly, the auto script can be really fun
Mechanism
A loop is created using alias and menu_cmd rpn commands and keys are bind to start and stop auto dodging
Setup
Create a autoexec.cfg file in Nexuiz/data folder under windows or .Nexuiz/data under linux. Now copy and paste the dodge script directly into the autoexec.cfg file
or simple create dodge.cfg and call it from autoexec placing "exec dodge.cfg". The autoexec will execute everytime Nexuiz client starts and you are good to go
